- **DayX.ipynb** – Daily Jupyter notebooks (Day1 to Day7), each covering key data science topics such as:
  - Data loading & cleaning
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Data visualization
  - Statistical analysis
  - Model building fundamentals

- **MiniProject1_DataAnalysis/** – A standalone project focused on exploring and deriving insights from a real-world dataset using pandas, matplotlib/seaborn, and statistical summary techniques.

- **MiniProject2_WebScraping/** – A web-scraping project that gathers data from selected websites using Beautiful Soup or Scrapy, followed by data cleaning and basic analysis.
